# volunteer

This is the official repository for the `volunteer` bot on the Possibility servers. This code has been open-sourced just to support the open-source community. Although, some functions are made to work specifically for the Possiblity servers. However, feel free to fork this code or download it and rework it to your own needs, there are comments throughout the project so that you can find your way around everything (somewhat at least).
